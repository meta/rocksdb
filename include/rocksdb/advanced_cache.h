// A Cache maps keys to objects resident in memory, tracks reference counts
// on those key-object entries, and is able to remove unreferenced entries
// whenever it wants. All operations are fully thread safe except as noted.

// unspecified units, typically bytes of memory used. A Cache will typically
// have a finite capacity in units of charge, and evict entries as needed
// to stay at or below that capacity.
//
// NOTE: This API is for expert use only and is intended more for customizing
// cache behavior than for calling into outside of RocksDB. It is subject to
// change as RocksDB evolves, especially the RocksDB block cache. Overriding
// CacheWrapper is the preferred way of customizing some operations on an
// existing implementation.
