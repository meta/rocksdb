// A WalIterator reads WriteBatches out of a DB's write-ahead log, in
// increasing sequence number order. It is obtained from DB::GetUpdatesSince()
// and is the basis of "WAL tailing": following a DB's writes as they happen,
// for replication, change data capture, and similar.
//
// SOURCE OF DATA -- THIS ONLY SEES THE WAL
//
// This iterator returns exactly what was recorded in the WAL, which is not
// the same as everything that happened to the DB. Notably, these advance the
// DB's sequence number without writing any WAL record:
//   * writes with WriteOptions::disableWAL = true
//   * DB::IngestExternalFile(), when it assigns a sequence number to the
//     ingested file
// These leave permanent holes in the sequence numbers visible here, which
// this API reports as an error (see STATES below) rather than skipping. A DB
// that uses either of them can still be followed up to the first such hole,
// but cannot be followed continuously.
//
// A WAL append that returns IOError is indeterminate: its physical record may
// be absent, incomplete, or complete. After RocksDB successfully resumes live
// from a supported file-scoped WAL error, the error-returned write is abandoned
// and its sequence range is reserved. For the lifetime of that DB instance,
// this iterator stops before the range rather than returning a physically
// complete record that is not part of the recovered DB. Other WAL errors, or a
// close before successful live resumption, do not provide this guarantee; a
// complete record may instead be replayed on the next open and appear normally
// here.
//
// The WAL is also not retained indefinitely. Set Options::WAL_ttl_seconds
// and/or Options::WAL_size_limit_MB large enough to cover how far behind a
// consumer may fall; otherwise WAL files are recycled or deleted aggressively
// and the data a consumer still needs may be gone before it is read.
//
// Not supported for TransactionDB with the WritePrepared or WriteUnprepared
// write policies; GetUpdatesSince() returns Status::NotSupported() for those.
// (Despite the historical name TransactionLogIterator, this API has nothing
// to do with TransactionDB. "Transaction log" is an old synonym for
// write-ahead log.)
//
// STATES
//
// An iterator is in exactly one of three states:
//
//   1. Valid() == true
//      Positioned at a WriteBatch. status() is OK and GetBatch() may be
//      called. Next() advances.
//
//   2. Valid() == false, status() is OK
//      Caught up: everything currently in the WAL at or after the requested
//      sequence number has been returned. This is NOT the end of iteration.
//      More writes may arrive, so a consumer that wants to keep following the
//      DB may call Next() again later, and Valid() may become true again.
//      This is the intended way to tail a DB, but note that it is polling:
//      Next() never waits for new writes, and there is no notification when
//      they arrive. A caught-up Next() returns promptly and leaves the
//      iterator in this same state, so the consumer chooses its own retry
//      interval.
//
//      Conversely, a later Next() may end the run (state 3) instead of
//      returning more data -- notably when the DB has moved on to a new WAL
//      file, as on a rotation. Whether the iterator ends the run at a
//      rotation or continues across it is not guaranteed either way, so a
//      consumer tailing a DB must be prepared to build a new iterator
//      whenever the run ends. With DBOptions::wal_iterator_tail_rotations
//      enabled, reaching the end of the file snapshot can continue into a
//      newer live WAL when its records are contiguous with the run. Callers
//      still need the recovery path below when continuation is not possible.
//
//   3. Valid() == false, status() is not OK
//      The run is over and the iterator is spent. status() will not change
//      and Next() has no effect. To continue, discard this iterator and call
//      DB::GetUpdatesSince() again -- but see GAPS below first.
//
// Statuses that end a run:
//   * Status::TryAgain -- not an error in itself. The iterator has reached
//     the end of the WAL data it can currently see while the DB has moved on,
//     e.g. after a WAL rotation or when newer writes are not yet readable
//     from the WAL; a new iterator may be able to continue from here.
//   * Status::NotFound("Gap in sequence numbers") -- the batch just read is
//     not contiguous with the previous one, i.e. a discontinuity in the WAL
//     (see SOURCE OF DATA and GAPS). This status is also returned before a
//     sequence range reserved by live resumption from a file-scoped WAL write
//     error.
//   * Status::Corruption and I/O errors -- the WAL could not be read.
//
// These are hints, not a classification to branch on. The same underlying
// cause can surface as different statuses: a hole from disableWAL or
// IngestExternalFile() ends the run with NotFound when a later batch is still
// visible past it, but with TryAgain when it falls at the end of what the
// iterator can currently see. Do not infer from the status whether the
// missing data is recoverable; treat any non-OK status as "the run has
// ended," build a new iterator, and verify continuity (see GAPS).
//
// GAPS AND RESUMING A RUN
//
// Within a single run, this iterator stops rather than skipping over a gap in
// sequence numbers, so a run is contiguous and a consumer need not re-check
// that.
//
// What is not guaranteed is the seam between runs. Starting a run is
// permissive: DB::GetUpdatesSince(seq) positions at the next available
// WriteBatch when seq itself is no longer available, and reports no error for
// doing so. Because recovering from any of the run-ending statuses above
// means calling GetUpdatesSince() again, the recovery step is exactly the
// step that can silently skip data.
//
// This matters because a consumer applying these batches to a copy of the DB
// diverges permanently and undetectably if it misses one. So on the first
// batch of each new iterator, check that it resumes where the previous one
// stopped: that BatchResult::sequence equals the last delivered batch's
// sequence plus its WriteBatch::Count(). On a mismatch the intervening
// updates are gone from the WAL, so re-seed from a checkpoint rather than
// resuming.
